# Comparision of two articles about data-ralted issues
In this document, I summarize the main opinons of two articles about the data related issues.
## Article 1
In PNAS's [Issues with data and analyses: Errors, underlying themes and potential solutions] (https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1708279115) 

The authohr argues that everyone makes mistakes, even top scientists. Some mistakes can teach us new things, but others can lead to wrong answers. It's really important to find and fix these errors to keep science reliable. A big problem in research is when the data isn't collected properly, called "bad data". This can give wrong results and make people doubt the research.

Science involves collecting, looking at, and talking about data. Sometimes mistakes happen in these steps. In this work, we talk about why it's important to spot and fix mistakes related to data and numbers. We look at common mistakes, how often they happen, and what they mean. Then, we talk about how these mistakes can affect our understanding. In the end, we suggest ways to make fewer mistakes in science, helping it to keep growing and getting better.

## Article 2 
Contrary to the above article, ADA's [Don't be afraid of big data] (https://newdentistblog.ada.org/dont-be-afraid-of-big-data/) The author has different opinon. After graduating from dental school in Iraq in 2009, there was a noticeable lack of engagement with practice statistics, surveys, and digital quality measures in various dental environments across countries. The shift towards understanding the significance of big data in dental care became apparent upon pursuing a second dental degree in California and taking on a role as a site dental director in community health care. This revealed that integrating and analyzing data could drastically enhance the quality of dental services.

Nowadays, many dental practices are embracing electronic dental records (EDR), simplifying data collection. Properly managed data analysis can elevate the quality of dental services and streamline workflows. Through data examination, high-risk patients for severe oral diseases can be identified, missed appointments reduced, and potential oral health deterioration preemptively addressed. Big data also facilitates a deeper understanding of disease patterns, enabling effective preventive measures. Delving into data trends uncovers opportunities to optimize practices, leading to notable improvements such as an 8% metric increase within 90 days. While numbers can be intimidating, they are invaluable tools that transform patient care and service quality. In essence, statistics don't depersonalize; they empower better care.

In conclusion, big data and data analyst will provide benefits to our life but we need to be cautious.
